Hello, I'm Rion. I'm a 16-year-old high school junior living in Washington state. I've been passionate about creating and problem solving in some form for my entire life. As a child, I developed a early and continued love for creation, whether it be drawing, creating my own superhero costumes, writing stories, and building with Lego. In the decade since, I may have outgrown some of those hobbies, but that sense of creation has stayed strongly instilled in me.
